# page-redirect-with-specified-page-variable-number
The code you provided  sets the $branch_id variable to 5, and then displays an alert message "Error Deleting Extension". After that, it redirects the page to '../branches.php?branch_id=' . $branch_id using JavaScript's window.location property.

The URL in the window.location will include the branch_id query parameter with the value of the $branch_id variable, allowing you to pass the ID to the branches.php page. Make sure that the relative path '../branches.php' is correct and corresponds to the actual location of your branches.php file.
